Influencer Definition:Influencers are the person who has specialized knowledge,so it's obvious that they will reply to most of the peoples queries as they are good at it, For example in case of stack overflow we can see same set of people answering most of the questions, the same apply with reddit too, so the people who took part in more number of unique conversations and the people who replied to the queries of the most people are considered as influencer<br/>

# Dependencies:<br/>
   pip install pandas<br/>
   pip install json <br/>
   pip install collections-extended<br/>
 Should work with most of the versions but it's better to upgrade to the latest version by creating a virtual environment and working in that<br/>
